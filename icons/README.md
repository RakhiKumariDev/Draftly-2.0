# Placeholder Icons
# In a real project, you would include actual PNG icon files

# Icon Requirements for Chrome Extensions:
# - icon16.png (16x16 pixels) - Used in the extension management page
# - icon32.png (32x32 pixels) - Used in the extension management page and sometimes in the browser action
# - icon48.png (48x48 pixels) - Used in the extension management page
# - icon128.png (128x128 pixels) - Used during installation and in the Chrome Web Store

# To create these icons:
# 1. Design a 128x128 pixel icon in your preferred graphics editor
# 2. Export as PNG with transparent background
# 3. Create smaller versions (16x16, 32x32, 48x48) by scaling down
# 4. Ensure all icons are crisp and readable at their respective sizes

# Recommended tools:
# - Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop
# - Figma
# - GIMP (free alternative)
# - Canva
# - Online icon generators

# Design Guidelines:
# - Use simple, recognizable imagery
# - Ensure good contrast
# - Make it scalable (vector-based if possible)
# - Follow Google's Material Design principles
# - Use your brand colors
# - Make it distinctive and memorable

# For this demo, you can:
# 1. Create simple colored squares as placeholders
# 2. Use free icon resources like Flaticon or Icons8
# 3. Generate icons using online tools
# 4. Commission a designer for professional icons

# Note: Without actual icon files, the extension will use default Chrome icons
